  <h4>What is this?</h4>
  <p>This is a tool for Eve Online aimed at being able to quickly price check items in bulk. </p>

  <h4>How are prices calculated?</h4>
  <p>Prices calculated from recent market data from Eve Online's ESI API. Items with low (or no) market volume use CCP's pricing estimates.</p>

  <h4>What does a purple row mean?</h4>
  <p>Purple rows are items that {{.UI.SiteName}} had a hard time finding an accurate and current price for. This is usually caused by low (or no) market volume for that item.</p>

  <h4>Caveats/Known Issues</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>There's no reliable way to get prices of blueprint copies (BPCs). Due to this, {{.UI.SiteName}} doesn't even try to guess a price for them.</li>
    <li>Non-english formats don't always work properly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Is there an API?</h4>
  <p>Yes! A very simple one, but it will probably get you what you want. <a href="/about/api/">Click here to see the API Documentation</a>.</p>

  <h4>Why's this so similar to evepraisal.com</h4>
  <p>This is a fork of evepraisal.com, which is originally written by
  &quot;Magerawr&quot;, and it's not bad. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I just wanted to add 1DQ1-A to it. I
  can't promise I'll backport new features continuously.</span></p>
